##### TODO:
- configuration system
- database (sqlite for portability?)
- ssl
- verify pings and prune lagging clients
- admin/mod login via server password
- admin/mod commands via /anonirc <args>
- admins/mods can say something official in a channel, it will also come with a notice to grab attention
- server admin password (set in config) allows global admin privileges
- channel registration to three passwords (founder/admin/mod)
  - only the founder and optionally some admins can regenerate these passwords
  - each channel password can be supplied during connection as server password (e.g. #lobby/swordfish:#lounge/8ball) or via a command
- private channels (+k implementation)
- implement read locks...? are they necessary?
- /list support
- move userlist updates to more efficient goroutine monitoring changes
- whois anonymous<#> easter egg, could be pre-programmed witty phrases/quotes
- op users (locally) when they are logged in to a founder/admin/mod password for client compatibility
- send supported user and channel modes when new user connects
